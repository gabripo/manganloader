# manganloader

## Characteristics
- download of raw images using [mloader](https://github.com/hurlenko/mloader)
- EPUB / CBZ generation through [KCC](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/tree/master)
- PDF generation through Pillow (yeah, easy there)

### Deployed version
The application has been deployed onto Render:
[https://manganloader.onrender.com/](https://manganloader.onrender.com/)
Since I am poor, the website sometimes does not load as stuck - Render has a timeout for poor users - then wait few minutes until it spins up again.
Ah, there are some memory constraints in the host machine on Render, then the application sometimes does not generate the files (if they are too big). Workaround: try again. I told you.

A lighter version has been deployed, as well:
[https://manganloader-simple.onrender.com/](https://manganloader-simple.onrender.com/)
The version does not rely on Selenium and Javascript to download mangas, hence its usage is restricted to those sources which do not require these tricks.
If you dare downloading mangas from these exotic sources, you will get an empty zip file - and you deserve it, I told you to not try!

## Docker Container
Everybody likes [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) üê≥.
I do, as well, then I provided a script to build an image üì¶:
```bash
chmod +x docker_build.sh
sh docker_build.sh
```
... and a script to run it üíû:
```bash
chmod +x docker_run.sh
sh docker_run.sh
```
The Dockerfile fetches the latest version of the repo, prepares the environment for deployment, serves the app through [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

## Local Installation
### Python dependencies
Use the `requirements.txt` file to load the high-level dependencies into a Python virtual environment - `env` in the following example:
```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### KCC as submodule
Use git to download the [KCC](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/tree/master) source code:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
KCC will be stored into the `kcc` folder - and invoked from there.

## In the next episodes... (a.k.a. "ToDo List")
- (front-end) Device selection if EPUB selected, we have KCC then we are powerful enough to generate device-specific files.
- Extend to other mangas, beucase HxH is not to be neglected.
- (back-end) Distinguish between SIMPLE (no Selenium) and NORMAL (with Selenium) version during deployment.
- (back-end) Use either Gunicorn or Flask to serve the application, can be changed with an environment variable.
